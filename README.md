# Uncommon Expo CLI Launch Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive set of errors encountered when launching Expo apps.  These errors often stem from inconsistencies between Node.js versions, Expo Go compatibility, and the underlying Metro bundler.

## Symptoms

- Failure to launch the app on a physical device or simulator.
- Cryptic error messages during the build process (often related to Metro Bundler).
- Network request errors.
- Bundling failures.

## Reproduction

The `expoBug.js` file contains a simplified project setup that may trigger the error under certain conditions.  Experiment with different Node.js versions to see if you can reproduce the issue. (Note: Specific steps to reproduce may vary depending on the underlying cause.)

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers several approaches to resolve these launch errors, including:

- **Updating Node.js:** Ensure you have a compatible and recent version of Node.js installed.  Consult the Expo documentation for recommended versions.
- **Updating Expo Go:** Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo Go app installed on your device.
- **Clearing the cache:** Running `expo start --clear` can often resolve transient issues.
- **Checking project dependencies:** Verify all your project dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with your chosen Expo SDK version.
- **Inspecting the terminal output:** Carefully examine the error messages provided by the Expo CLI; they often contain crucial clues.
