This error typically arises when using the Expo CLI with older versions of Node.js or incompatible versions of Expo Go.  It manifests as a failure to launch the app on the device or simulator, often accompanied by cryptic error messages in the terminal related to bundling, network requests, or Metro bundler issues.  Specific error messages can vary widely, making diagnosis challenging.
