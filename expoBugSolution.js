This solution focuses on addressing common causes of cryptic Expo CLI launch errors.

**1. Update Node.js:**
```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
npm install -g node@latest
```

**2. Update Expo CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

**3. Update Expo Go:**
Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo Go app installed on your device (or simulator).  The Expo Go app will often automatically update itself, but you may need to manually check your app store.

**4. Clear the Cache:**
```bash
expo start --clear
```

**5. Check Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**6. Inspect Error Messages:**  Pay close attention to the terminal output when launching your Expo app.  Error messages often contain specific guidance on the issue.

**7. Consider using EAS Build:**
For production builds, explore using Expo's EAS Build system, which often provides a more stable and consistent build process.
